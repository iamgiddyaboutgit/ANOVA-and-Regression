## Checking the Assumptions
After running your ANOVA, check that the assumptions about the errors are met so that you can do statistical inference. Those assumptions are:

1. \(\text{E}(\epsilon_{ij})=0,\ \text{Var}(\epsilon_{ij})=\sigma_{i}^2 < \infty,\ \text{for all }i, j.\)
2. The \(\epsilon_{ij}\) are mutually independent and normally distributed.
3. \(\sigma_{i}^2=\sigma^2\ \text{for all } i.\)

### Checking Assumption 1
### Assumption 1 was violated.
### Checking Assumption 2
### Assumption 2 was violated.
### Checking Assumption 3
### Assumption 3 was violated.
A variance-stabilizing transformation of the response variable may help. 

```{r}
data("data_mortality")
transformed_response = transfo(data_mortality, prestandardize = FALSE)
hist(data_mortality[, 1])
hist(transformed_response$Xt[, 1])
shapiro.test(data_mortality[, 1])
shapiro.test(transformed_response$Xt[, 1])
```
