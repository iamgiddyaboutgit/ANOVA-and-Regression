Open the link above to access the webpage for this book.  This book is meant to be a personal guide to ANOVA and regression.  Maybe you will find some useful information in it, but it was by no means written by an expert.  That being said, I would appreciate any comments.

This is book was built using **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
